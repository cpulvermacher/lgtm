A CUSTOM PROMPT

Output rules:
- Respond with a JSON list of comments objects, which contain the fields `comment`, `line`, and `severity`.
`comment` is a string describing the issue.
`line` is the first affected LINE NUMBER.
`severity` is the severity of the issue as an integer from 1 (likely irrelevant) to 5 (critical).
- Respond with only JSON, do NOT include other text or markdown.

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "comment": "The <script> tag is misspelled as <scirpt>.",
    "line": 23,
    "severity": 4
  },
  {
    "comment": "Using `eval()` with a possibly user-supplied string may result in code injection.",
    "line": 55,
    "severity": 5
  }
]
```
